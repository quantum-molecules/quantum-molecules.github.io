[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a researcher working on experimental quantum physics with trapped ions at the University of Innsbruck.\nWe are investigating a physical platform that might host a future quantum computer - Trapped atomic ions. The quantum register consists of a string of individual atoms that store information in their internal state. We confine ionized Calcium atoms and manipulate their state with laser pulses. Below is an image of a 55 ion quantum register from our EU flagship project AQTION.\nI have received an ERC starting grant to apply these quantum computing techniques to polyatomic molecules within the QCosmo project. In particular, I plan to characterize and control ultrafast quantum processes single polyatomic molecules by coupling them to trapped atomic ions. Ultimately, we hope to exploit these quantum effects in molecules as a versatile foundation for future quantum technologies.\nI am currently looking for motivated PhD students and PostDocs that will join me on this scientific journey. If you are interested in coming to Innsbruck, contact me.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/philipp-schindler/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/philipp-schindler/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a researcher working on experimental quantum physics with trapped ions at the University of Innsbruck.\nWe are investigating a physical platform that might host a future quantum computer - Trapped atomic ions.","tags":null,"title":"Philipp Schindler","type":"authors"}]
