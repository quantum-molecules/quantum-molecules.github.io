In parallel, quantum error correction codes that can protect quantum information encoded in rotational states of a single molecule have been developed. These codes are currently an abstract concept, as no implementation strategy is yet known. Here, we present a step towards experimental implementation of these codes by introducing architecture-agnostic check and correction operators. These operators can be decomposed into elements of the quantum logic spectroscopy toolbox that is available for molecular ions. We then describe and analyze a measurement-based sequential as well as an autonomous implementation strategy in the presence of thermal background radiation, a major noise source for rotation in polar molecules. The presented strategies and methods might enable robust sensing or even fault-tolerant quantum computing using the rotation of individual molecules.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Strategies for implementing quantum error correction in molecular rotation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhenlin Wu","Stefan Walser","Verena Podlesnic","Mariano Isaza-Monsalve","Elyas Mattivi","Guanqun Mu","René Nardi","Piotr Gniewek","Michał Tomza","Brandon J.

On the other hand, they are also a hindrance to scaling up quantum computers based on atomic ions as unavoidable reactions with background gas destroy the information carriers. Here, we investigate the single- and two-photon dissociation processes of single CaOH+ molecular ions co-trapped in Ca+ ion crystals using a femtosecond laser system. We report the photodissociation cross section spectra of CaOH+ for single-photon processes at λ=245 - 275nm and for two-photon processes at λ=500 - 540nm. Measurements are interpreted with quantum-chemical calculations, which predict the photodissociation threshold for CaOH+→Ca++OH at 265nm. This result can serve as a basis for dissociation-based spectroscopy for studying the internal structure of CaOH+. The result also gives a prescription for recycling Ca+ ions in large-scale trapped Ca+ quantum experiments from undesired CaOH+ ions formed in the presence of background water vapor.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Photodissociation spectra of single trapped CaOH+ molecular ions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://www.quantum-molecules.eu/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Philipp Schindler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565568000,"objectID":"044d5d422ee6727aa635412306d55d28","permalink":"https://www.quantum-molecules.eu/publication/njp_theory/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/njp_theory/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a method to investigate the vibrational dynamics of single polyatomic molecular ions confined in a Paul trap. Quantum logic techniques are employed to detect the recoil of single photon absorption events on the molecule via a co-trapped atomic ion. In particular, the recoil is mapped onto the electronic state of the atom which can be read out with high fidelity. This recoil detection serves as the basis for a pump-probe scheme to investigate ultrafast molecular dynamics, such as intra-molecular vibrational redistribution. The total recoil from the interaction with a sequence of ultrafast laser pulses with the molecular vibration is measured. This work discusses the experimental requirements and expected performance for multiple molecular ions with masses ranging from 17 to 165 Dalton.","tags":[],"title":"Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy with single molecular ions","type":"publication"}]
